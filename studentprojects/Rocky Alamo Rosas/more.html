                     <h3>MORE INFORMATION</h3>

        <p>today, police disproportionately use force against black people, and black people are more likely to get to be arrested and sentenced. Phillip McHarris,a doctoral candidate in sociology at Yale University and lead research and policy associate at the Community Resource Hub for Safety and Accountability, says he had "real, discernible threats of gun violence," growing up in his neighborhood but never thought to call the police for his own safety.</p>

                     <h3>WHY REFORMING THE POLICE ISN'T WORKING</h3>
        <img src="https://www.senatorkearney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PoliceReform-1080x630.jpg" alt="reform">
        <p> police reforms (procedural reforms) are changes to police department protocals such as implicit bias training, mindfulness and police-community encounters. these procedural changes can cost millions of dollars. minneapolis was a model for progressive policing reform, but those procedures have been ineffective in stopping police abuse. in the last 40 years, police power and jurisdiction have expanded massively, especially in poor communities of color. </p>
