<p> - defunding the police does not mean abolishing the police all together. it means redirecting the funds from police departments to social services.</p>    
<p> - 52% of police officers report that it is not unusual for law enforcement officials to turn a blind eye to the improper conduct of other officers, and 61% of police officers state that they do not always report serious abuse that has been directly observed by fellow officers. (US Department of Justice) </p>
<p> - the police response does not serve the best interests for poor communities color. instead of investing in poor communities of color, they invest in greater police presence and granting them manageral authority. redirecting funds can uplift these communities while also reducing crime and increasing safety.</p>
