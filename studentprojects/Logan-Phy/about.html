         <p>Hello! This page is more about me, the developer of this website. I'll talk about my hobbies and the website.</p>   
       <p> This is the first website I've ever made! I am still learning so it's a bit rough around the edges. </p>
       <p>When I'm not making my website I usually play video games, playing video games is one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
        <p>Soccer is one of my favorite sports, I do like playing the sport but I don't like watching it on tv.</p>
       <p>I wanted to talk about noise pollution because I felt it was an issue that's always been pushed to the side, it just didn't sit right with me.</p>
       <p>I love all animals, especially chickens for some reason, because I believe that they are nature's gifts to us.</p>     
       <p>That's pretty much all I want to say thank you for coming to my website!</p>
