               <p><b>What is Noise Pollution and what are the areas that it affects:</b> Noise Pollution is a large, harmful amount of noise. Usually, Noise Pollution will be somewhat continuous, but that doesn't mean that the volume of noise being produced can become louder or quieter. Usually, it's common to find continuous noise pollution in large cities. In rural areas, continuous noise pollution is rare, but sometimes when an activity like deforrestation or a parade happens it can cause Noise Pollution in the area.</p>
               <p><b> What Are Some Negative Effects of Noise Pollution:</b> The most common negative effect of noise pollution is hearing loss. Another common effect is induced stress from constant noise. An additional effect would be insomnia, lacking in the ability to sleep, caused mostly by Noise Pollution that carries on into nighttime. </p>
               <p><b>How to determine what areas are affected by Noise Pollution:</b> Areas with Noise Pollution commonly are big cities, so it would be obvious to see if any surveys were conducted in big cities. You can do the same for same for small towns as well. If most of the subjects surveyed displayed strong cases of the symptoms shown above, it's highly likely that the city they live in is a city affected by Noise Pollution, or you can go to the resources page and click on the Noise Pollution Map.</p>
