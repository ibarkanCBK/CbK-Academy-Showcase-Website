        <h1>People Affected By Noise Pollution</h1>
        </div>
        <div style="font-size:20px" class= "content">
            <p><b>Veterans:</b> Veterans suffering from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) can be affected by loud noises. Usually, they hallucinate and think that they are still on the battlefield. This can be a issue not only for the veteran's safety but also for other people around the veteran who could possibly be badly injured. So, it wouldn't be ideal for Noise Pollution to exist around veterans' living space. The main source that triggers their PTSD could be Noise Pollution stemming from fireworks which sound simmilar to firearms being fired. If there could be a petition to decrease firework usage, then this problem could be resolved. </p>
            <p><b>Infants:</b> Infants are known for crying, they do it quite often. Noise Pollution however, completely ups the anty. Loud noises can make infants scared and confused leading to crying fits. This is bad for many reasons. One reason is that it can keep the child's parents awake at night which might cause stress for both of the parents. Another reason is that an infant could grow up with poor communication skills, possibly because it's hard to concentrate in a noisy enviroment. In order to fix this problem there could be a policy in schools that says loud noise is prohibited. </p>
            <p><b>The Disabled:</b> Disabled individuals have a harder time with learning and concentrating, adding in Noise Pollution with them may lead to bad results. Loud noise may agitate those with autism and it can also distract people with ADHD. In order to fix this problem there could be a fundraiser for people with disabilities, it could help them get noise cacelling equipment to reduce the noise they hear.  </p>
