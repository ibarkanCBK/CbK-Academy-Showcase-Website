        <h2> The pressure to reduce costs and speed up production time means that environmental corners are cut in the name of profit. Fast Fashion’s negative impact includes the use of cheap, toxic textile dyes - with the fashion industry the second largest polluter of clean water globally after agriculture.</h2>

        <p>Fast fashion is a business model that uses cheap materials and labor to churn out clothing collections at a rapid pace and can be summed up as cheap, trendy clothing, that samples ideas from fashion shows and/or celebrity culture and turns them into garments available online and in stores almost overnight. </p>
        <p>Rather than being just a category, fast fashion is a model of mass-producing cheaply made, ‘of-the-moment’ items that are sold at a lower price point.</p>
        <p>Fashion a $2.5 trillion sector—is the second most polluting industry on Earth, right behind oil. </p>
        <p>The speed at which garments are produced also means that more and more clothes are disposed of by consumers, creating a huge amount of textile waste. In Canada, the average person throws out 81 pounds of textiles annually, while North Americans send 9.5 million tons of clothing to the landfill every year — most of which could be reused.</p>
