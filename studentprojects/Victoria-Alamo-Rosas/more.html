        <h2>What is Fast Fashion</h2>

<p>Fast fashion is a business model that uses cheap materials and labor to churn out clothing collections at a rapid pace and can be summed up as cheap, trendy clothing, that samples ideas from fashion shows and/or celebrity culture and turns them into garments available online and in stores almost overnight.  Rather than being just a category, fast fashion is a model of mass-producing cheaply made, ‘of-the-moment’ items that are sold at a lower price point. It also reflects the growing consumer desire for speed and value within retail. It means that, instead of waiting for new seasonal collections (i.e. spring / summer), consumers can get their hands on a continuous cycle of trend-led clothing, all year round.</p>

         <h3>How to spot a fast fashion brand</h3>

          <p>There are some key factors that are common to fast fashion brands:
Thousands of styles, which touch on all the latest trends.
Extremely short turnaround time between when a trend or garment is seen on the catwalk, or in celebrity media, and when it hits the shelves.
Offshore manufacturing where labour is the cheapest, with the use of workers on low wages without adequate rights or safety, as well as complex supply chains with poor visibility beyond the first tier and of subcontracting.
Limited quantity of a particular garment—this is an idea pioneered by Zara. With new stock arriving in store every few days, shoppers know if they don’t buy something they like they’ll probably miss their chance.
Cheap, low quality materials, where clothes degrade after just a few wears and get thrown away.</p>
