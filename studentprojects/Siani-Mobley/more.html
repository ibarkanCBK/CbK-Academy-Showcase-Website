    <p id="paragraph"> The school to prison pipeline is used to describe the disproportionate tendency of 
        <br>children from disadvantaged backgrounds who become incarcerated, due to harsh<br> punishments.
        Many students act out when they lack the accademic and emotional<br> support needed in school. Therefore
        teachers punish them rather than supporting <br>them. This system leaves mainly black children susceptible
        to suspension, detention,<br> and other punishments that could lead to incarceration. Federal civil rights 
        <br>investigations have found that black students face harsher consequences compared to<br>their white peers.
        Schools with relatively larger minority and poor populations are<br> more likely to implement criminal 
        justice related policies. If we change our policies<br> and practices to support, rather than punish and incarcerate
        children who may be<br> struggling, we can offer a better future for black children or children from<br> disadvantaged
        backgrounds</p>
