      <p>Merriam-Webster defines gentrification as the the process of repairing and rebuilding homes and businesses in a deteriorating area accompanied by an influx of more affluent people and that often results in the displacement of earlier, usually poorer residents.It stems from a practice called red lining which is where in the 1960's a federal agency called the Home Owners Loan Corporation gave neighborhoods ratings.Neighborhoods rated red or hazardous were not invested in. Often times red neigboorhoods were minority ones. In other words, there is a reason why some of these neighborhoods deteriorated which eventually makes them a perfect place for   greedy developers to come in and  start buying up properties. These new properties attract new people with money and more education. Then the new businesses come. All of this result in higher rent and property tax for residents who lived there before the development which often results in thier displacement.
