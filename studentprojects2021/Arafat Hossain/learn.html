        <h2>Student and Family problems</h2>
        <p>Students with a lack of internet access cannot efficiently ask for help from others, and oftentimes they can't work due to the internet cutting off while they do assignments. The website theedadvocate says that "There are many ways that a lack of internet access can affect a student's academic performance. Students without internet can't connect with teachers or classmates, do independent research, or get online homework help." Even while low and moderate-income families have some type of Internet access, which they use for tasks from doing homework to paying bills, the cost is still an issue despite the efforts made by internet providers to introduce affordable alternatives.</p>
        <p>Schools have started virtual instruction due to COVID-19. For students who don't have reliable internet access, completing assigned work from teachers is very tough. Parents have given their children technology, like phones or computers to cope with virtual learning. Even when students have their devices, they can't properly log into class because of internet issues.</p>

        <h2>Health Problems that come along with the absence of internet service</h2>
        <p>Again, internet poverty has created a larger gap between healthcare professionals and those in need of aid and support. This has led to more individuals being unable to care for their basic health needs. The website aspe.hhs.gov says "In these situations, access to the internet may be a factor in accessing critical benefits to support families dealing with the economic consequences of the response to the pandemic." With the absence of internet access, finding help will become hard especially since Covid-19 has become a major problem rendering certain people in need unable to get help.</p>
