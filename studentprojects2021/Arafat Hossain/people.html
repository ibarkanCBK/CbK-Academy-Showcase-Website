        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>There is a racial gap when it comes to internet access and internet speed. White and Asian households with school children have high-speed internet packages. When it comes to Black households, Hispanic households, etc, they are less likely to get high-speed internet packages, and some can't even get internet at all. 88% of White households and 92% of Asian households have fast internet, while 72% of Black and Hispanic households only have fast internet speed, the difference between the three ranges from 16%-20%</p>
        <p>According to The Christian Science Monitor, "94 percent of low and moderate-income families have some type of Internet access, which they use for tasks from doing homework to paying bills, the cost is still an issue despite some efforts by Internet providers to introduce affordable alternatives."</p>
