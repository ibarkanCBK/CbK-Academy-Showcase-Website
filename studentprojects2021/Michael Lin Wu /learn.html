        <h2>Definition of bullying</h2>
       
        <p>In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Department of Education released the first federal definition of bullying. The definition includes three core elements:
        <ol>
            <li> unwanted aggressive behavior</li>
            <li>observed or perceived power imbalance</li>
            <li>repetition or high likelihood of repetition of bullying behaviors</li>
        </ol>
