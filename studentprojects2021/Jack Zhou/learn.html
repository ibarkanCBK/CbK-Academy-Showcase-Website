        <h2>Details About Smoking</h2>
        <div id="learn-paragraphs-container">
            <p id="learn-paragraph1">Smoking is extremely addictive and can lead to a variety of different health issues. Smoking can increase the risk for coronary heart disease and stroke by 2 to 4 times. It increases the risk of men developing lung cancer by 25 times and 25.7 times for women. In fact, smoking is the cause of 90% of lung cancer deaths. Moreover, almost one-third of all cancer is related to smoking. It kills more women each year than breast cancer does. With how addicting smoking can be because of nicotine, merely a couple cigarettes can get you "hooked" on them.</p>
            <p id="learn-paragraph2">Although smoking is dangerous for the smokers, it can also affect the people around the smoker in negative ways. The smoke exhaled from the smoker is known as secondhand smoke and breathing it in is just as dangerous as smoking. Secondhand smoke has many harmful chemicals, some of which can cause cancer. Some symptoms of inhaling secondhand smoke include: irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, excessive mucus in the airways, chest discomfort due to lung irritation, and chest pain (which may indicate heart disease). 46,000 nonsmokers die from coronary heart disease, as a result of exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>
