            <h2 class="people-h2">The People Smoking Affects</h2>
            <p>People who are affected include families of people in any age group, who are smoking, adolescents that are easily pressured into doing something, and people with (or even without) respiratory issues that often take public transportation in low-income neighborhoods in the city where there are usually many smokers. Twenty percent of 12th graders smoke daily and at least 4.5 million adolescents are smokers.</p>
            <h2 class="people-h2">How It Affects Them</h2>
            <p>Because of secondhand smoke (smoke that smokers exhale), if you live or are often near smokers, you can suffer the same health issues as smokers would (even if you don't smoke)! Along with the fact that smoking is becoming increasingly common in adolescents, it makes it hard to live your life without encountering a smoker every couple days at least. The simplest solution is to spread awareness and persuade family members to at least try and stop smoking! If you have a child that smokes, then now is the time to tell them to stop and find an addiction treatment center for them.</p>
