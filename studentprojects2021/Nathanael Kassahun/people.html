       <h2> People </h2>
        The people affected are typically young adults who start smoking, usually to cope with stress, pressured by friends at parties, or just trying it for the first time from the heavy-duty advertisements that have been out,  who then take this habit with them throughout their life. To reduce the amount of smokers in Philadelphia, you first have to cut off the source, which is essentially convincing young people and young adults that they shouldnâ€™t smoke. Once this is established you focus those who smoke and convince them to quit.  
        <p2> The hardest part about quitting is the first two weeks. Once you get past the first two weeks, you start to forget what the feel of a cigarette is like and learn to live without it until it becomes a habit. Once you make it past the first two weeks, it gets easier and easier and your body will thank you as the effects start to wear off on you. Quitting will be challenging but not impossible.
