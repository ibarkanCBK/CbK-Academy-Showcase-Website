       <h2> Effects of Smoking </h2>
        
Smoking is the highest leading preventable cause of deaths in the US. Smoking is very bad for your health. It increases your chances at diseases and makes breathing difficult. Smoking harms and damages your lungs and makes living day to day life harder to perform things you would have no struggle with before smoking. For example, once you start smoking, youâ€™ll find things just as focusing harder to do because it damages your cortex, which is what allows you to process information.
        
        <h3> Pros of Quitting</h3>
        
Quitting is the first step to restoring your body. Although it will be hard to start quitting, once you do you will notice many positive effects. You will find breathing easier, reduced chance of diseases such as lung cancer, it will be easier to focus and concentrate, reduced risk of heart attack, and after about 15 years your body will have fully outgrown the effects of smoking. The sooner you start, the sooner the effects will start to wear off and the sooner you can live life better.
