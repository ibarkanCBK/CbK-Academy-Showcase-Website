        <h2> Biography</h2>
    
        <p>
    I am an Ethiopian-American child born and raised in Northeast Philadelphia as of August 20th, 2007. I live with my parents and two year older sister. I follow Orthodox Christianity and am a good member of the Ethiopian community. In October, I will be a deacon in my church and have been studying for years for the day I’m ordained. 
Outside of church, I spend my time playing sports like tennis with friends at nearby courts, basketball with my net on the driveway, and bike riding in my neighborhood. On rainy days when I can’t go out I just watch TV and play video games with friends. The year of publishing this website I will be going into ninth grade at Masterman High School. I plan on finishing high school and college and want to be either a lawyer or a doctor.
