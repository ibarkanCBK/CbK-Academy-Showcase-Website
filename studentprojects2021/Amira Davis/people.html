        <p>I have gotta this information from a interview </p>
        
            <p>*Elderly people who once could sit on their porches or steps in front of their homes are scared to even come outside their home to walk to the store out of fear they may be gunned down. “My mom is 78 years old and has lived in north philadelphia for over 32 years and is afraid to come out of her own home, a young boy she watched grow up was murder just at the corner of her block just last year.”
