            <p style="margin: 0px 200px;">Education can present opportunities that would have been absent without it. If children struggle in school, or even do not attend school, the statistics show that their income will be lower than if they had gotten a quality education. However, for the children listed above and even many more, school is difficult because there are not adequate resources or measures put into place to make sure they succeed. This starts the cycle of poverty, with their children facing similar issues. </p>
