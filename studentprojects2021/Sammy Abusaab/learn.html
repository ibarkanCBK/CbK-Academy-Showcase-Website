    <h2 id="heading-number-2">Effects of Bad Air Quality</h2>
    <p id="paragraph">The quality of the air that we breathe is very important because bad air quality can lead to trouble breathing, increased risk of birth defects, increased risk of disease, and lower reproductive rates. It is an issue that affects every human on Earth, and the environment. Gases mixing with oxygen and water can cause acid rain which kills crops, harming animals and humans who eat from the crops. It also leads to climate change which can become an irreversible issue that would make the Earth uninhabitable. </p>

    <h2 id="heading-number-3">Our Impact</h2>
    <p id="second-paragraph">One of the major causes of air pollution is vehicle exhaust fumes. This can be from any type of vehicle such as boats, cars, planes and trucks. You can help lower your carbon footprint by taking the time out of your day to walk or ride a bike instead of driving a car to take a step towards bettering the Earth. Another major cause of air pollution is factories. Factories in the U.S. emit 3 million tons of toxic chemicals into the Earth. A way to help reduce industrial pollution is by switching to a cleaner energy source such as natural gas or water instead of coal which heavily damages the environment.</p>
