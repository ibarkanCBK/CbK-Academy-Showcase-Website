        <h2>Who Are the People Affected</h2>
        <p>Everyone on Earth is affected by air pollution, no matter who you are. However, some people are more susceptible to the risks such as people who live in heavily populated areas such as Tokyo or Mexico City, people affected by respiratory diseases and older people with weaker lungs. </p>

        <h2>Additional Info</h2>
        <p>Air pollution directly affects thousands of people every day. According to WHO, one-third of deaths from strokes, lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution. Acid rain, one cause of bad air quality, is responsible for poisoning the soil used for crops which is directly linked to 500 deaths per year. A map created by NASA shows global ammonia hotspots that were identified over a 14 year period. The map shows an increase of the deadly air pollutant, ammonia, in more urban regions with higher numbers of pollution. </p>
