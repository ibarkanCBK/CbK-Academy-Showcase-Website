            <h2>Who Is Affected?</h2>
            <p>
                People that are in low-income communities and are attending a public school are the most affected by underfunded education. These are the people who have less resources and opportunities to do what they want. Parents and guardians of those attending a public school are also heavily affected as they are the ones who often purchase many of the supplies that students will need. Students, parents, and guardians of low-income communities are hit the hardest by underfunded education as lower-income communities will almost always have underfunded schools.
