            <h2>School Budget</h2>
            <p>
                In the past decade, there have been multiple decreases in the funding. One of the most prominent examples is in 2011 and 2012 where state and federal funding decreased by 14%. Yet again in 2014, Pennsylvania was forced to shut down 31 schools. This left 4,000 teachers, librarians, counselors, nurses, and support staff without work.

            <p>
                Less wealthy school districts have far less money to spend. On average, the poorest 20% of school districts have $7,866 less per student than the wealthiest 20%. Even within a school district, the amount that a school spends will vary greatly based on what neighborhood it's in. The quality of education for a student can depend so much on where they live.
